# USB-boot-image-for-Raspberry-Pi-400-4-3-2-zero-zerow-old
From this repository you can download and try out USB booting from any OS for the Raspberry Pi with any version. But everyone know that Raspberry Pi already supports USB booting but this project is different! As we know that some operating systems like Windows 10 on ARM do not support USB bootiing  properly and even some other linux distros which are speifically made for the Raspberry pi do not support USB booting and even some older Raspberry Pi boards such as Raspberry Pi zero series boards do not support USB booting even when I try to install an operating system which supports USB booting will not work whatever you do but from this project you can boot from any raspberry pi zero and other older boards which use Broadcom ARM Cortex A-72 core Architecture and you can even boot from a OS that does not support USB booting
This project is licenced by an MIT liscence
